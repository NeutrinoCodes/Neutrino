# Overview
Neutrino can be successfully installed and used on Linux, Mac or Windows. The recommended installation suggests the use of the **VScode** editor, because this exists in all three operating systems and it works in combination of their corresponding native C/C++ environments. This provides a universal toolchain that gives advantages when working from different types of machines. The installation of Neutrino, along this toolchain, is only sligthly different according to the underlying operating system.

# Linux 

## Hardware requirements:
- **OpenCL-OpenGL interoperability GPU mode**. Use the command line tool `clinfo` (see *Software requirements*) to check for the availability of this mode. On a terminal do:\
`clinfo`\
\
In the text output (it can be long!) there should be a section regarding your GPU similar to this one:\
...\
`Name:                                          GeForce GTX 1060 6GB`\
`Vendor:                                        NVIDIA Corporation`\
`Driver version:                                451.67`\
`Profile:                                       FULL_PROFILE`\
`Version:                                       OpenCL 1.2 CUDA`\
`Extensions:                                    cl_khr_global_int32_base_atomics cl_khr_global_int32_extended_atomics cl_khr_local_int32_base_atomics cl_khr_local_int32_extended_atomics cl_khr_fp64 cl_khr_byte_addressable_store cl_khr_icd cl_khr_gl_sharing cl_nv_compiler_options cl_nv_device_attribute_query cl_nv_pragma_unroll cl_nv_d3d10_sharing cl_khr_d3d10_sharing cl_nv_d3d11_sharing cl_nv_copy_opts cl_nv_create_buffer cl_khr_int64_base_atomics cl_khr_int64_extended_atomics`\
...\
\
and verify the presence of the `cl_khr_gl_sharing` extension.

## Software requirements:

- Clinfo (https://github.com/Oblomov/clinfo)
- OpenCL (runtime/loader + headers), coming along the installation of the graphics drivers
- OpenGL (library + headers), coming along the installation of the graphics drivers
- GIT (https://git-scm.com)
- GLAD (https://glad.dav1d.de/) *
- GLFW (https://www.glfw.org/)
- GMSH (https://gmsh.info/)
- GCC (https://gcc.gnu.org) **
- CMake (https://cmake.org) **
- GraphViz (https://graphviz.org/)
- Doxygen (http://www.doxygen.nl/)

Under Linux, it should be possible to install most of those packages via the system's package manager.

\* The GLAD loader should be generated from its webpage using the following settings:
- Language = C/C++
- gl = Version 4.6 (or greater)
- Profile = Core

After having generated it, download the zip file containing the code and extract it in a custom directory (see *Installation*).

\** It is recommended to use the **VScode editor** and follow the instructions (https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-linux) in order to install it and verify the installation of GCC, as well as the instructions (https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/cmake-linux) to verify the installation of Cmake and to install the Cmake Tools extension for VSCode.

## Installation:
The recommended method is by using the VScode toolchain hereby described. We assume Neutrino is going to be installed in a directory named *NeutrinoCodes* containing the following subdirectories:
- glad
- glfw
- gmsh

where the corresponding software, according to the software requirements in this guide, has been already installed.

1. From the command shell (either VScode's or system's), navigate into *NeutrinoCodes* and create a `libnu` directory using the command:\
`mkdir libnu`\
\
This will create the `libnu` directory.

2. From the command shell (either VScode's or system's), navigate into *NeutrinoCodes* and clone the Neutrino project using the command:\
`git clone https://github.com/NeutrinoCodes/neutrino.git` \
\
This will create the `neutrino` directory.

3. Go to the `neutrino` directory and create a `.vscode` hidden directory:\
`mkdir .vscode`\
\
and create a new file `settings.json` in it, then fill it with the following information:\
`{`\
&nbsp;&nbsp;`"C_Cpp.default.configurationProvider": "vector-of-bool.cmake-tools",`\
&nbsp;&nbsp;`"cmake.configureArgs" : [   `\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`"-DGLAD_PATH=your_path_to_NeutrinoCodes/glad,`\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`"-DGLFW_PATH=your_path_to_NeutrinoCodes/glfw",`\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`"-DGMSH_PATH=your_path_to_NeutrinoCodes/gmsh",`\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`"-DNEUTRINO_PATH=your_path_to_NeutrinoCodes/libnu"`\
&nbsp;&nbsp;`]`\
`}`\
\
and save it.\
\
At this point, Neutrino is configured for your system. 

4. In VScode, go to the left bar and locate the **CMake** button (it comes after the installation of the CMake Tools extension for VScode) and push it: a CMake panel will open, push the **Configure All Projects** button on it.

5. In VScode, go to the bottom bar and locate the **Target** button: verify it has been selected to **[install]**.

6. In VScode, go to the bottom bar and locate the **Build** button: push it in order to build the Neutrino project.\
\
At this point the NeutrinoCodes directory should appear like this:
- glad
- glfw
- gmsh
- libnu
- neutrino

Congratulations, you have installed Neutrino on Linux!

# Mac 

## Hardware requirements:
- **OpenCL-OpenGL interoperability GPU mode**. Use the command line tool `clinfo` (see *Software requirements*) to check for the availability of this mode. On a terminal do:\
`clinfo`\
\
In the text output (it can be long!) there should be a section regarding your GPU similar to this one:\
...\
`Device Name                                     HD Graphics 5000`\
`Device Vendor                                   Intel`\
`Device Vendor ID                                0x1024500`\
`Device Version                                  OpenCL 1.2`\
`Driver Version                                  1.2(May 26 2020 20:53:48)`\

`Device Type                                     GPU`\
`Device Profile                                  FULL_PROFILE`\
...\
`Device Extensions                               cl_APPLE_SetMemObjectDestructor cl_APPLE_ContextLoggingFunctions cl_APPLE_clut cl_APPLE_query_kernel_names cl_APPLE_gl_sharing cl_khr_gl_event cl_khr_global_int32_base_atomics cl_khr_global_int32_extended_atomics cl_khr_local_int32_base_atomics cl_khr_local_int32_extended_atomics cl_khr_byte_addressable_store cl_khr_image2d_from_buffer cl_khr_gl_depth_images cl_khr_depth_images cl_khr_3d_image_writes`\
...\
\
and verify the presence of the `cl_APPLE_gl_sharing` extension.

## Software requirements:

- Clinfo (https://github.com/Oblomov/clinfo)
- OpenCL (runtime/loader + headers), coming along the OS-X installation.
- OpenGL (library + headers), coming along the OS-X installation.
- GIT (https://git-scm.com)
- GLAD (https://glad.dav1d.de/) *

<p align="center">
<img src="./Pictures/Installation_mac/libglfw_mac_alert_1.png"/>
</p>
or this one:
<p align="center">
<img src="./Pictures/Installation_mac/libglfw_mac_alert_3.png"/>
</p>

In that case, you should enable it from the Mac OS-X *Security & Privacy* panel:\

## Installation:
The recommended method is by using the VScode toolchain hereby described. We assume Neutrino is going to be installed in a directory named *NeutrinoCodes* containing the following subdirectories:
- glad
- glfw
- gmsh

where the corresponding software, according to the software requirements for Linux in this guide, has been already installed.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: GMSH is used in Neutrino as an API library. It can work in two modes: its sources can be used together with Neutrino's during the compilation of the latter one or as and external library. Under a Windows purely native environment there is a limitation (see https://gitlab.onelab.info/gmsh/gmsh/-/issues/894) and because of this it can used only as an external DLL. When using a library this way, the manufacturer of it provides three things: a `.dll` executable, a `.h` header file and a `.lib` file. The `.h` header file should be compatible on the target computer with the symbols of the functions of the `.dll` described in the `.lib`: this is not always the case if the DLL has been compiled by a C/C++ compiler which is different than the one the end user of the library has got on the target computer. Carefully reading all README files present in the GMSH's *Download the Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows 64-bit* distribution it turned out that the only way to use the GMSH API library **on Windows** is by **installing the GMSH SDK** and by following this procedure coming from the following note of installation of an example application built around the GMHS's API:

If your C++ compiler does not have a compatible ABI and if there are no
compatibility flags available, you can rename `gmsh.h_cwrap' as `gmsh.h': this implementation redefines the C++ API in terms of the C API. Using this header will lead to (slightly) reduced performance compared to using the native Gmsh C++ API from the original `gmsh.h' header, as it entails additional data copies between this C++ wrapper, the C API and the native C++ code. For example, the Windows SDK is currently compiled using the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC). To compile a C++ example with Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 in the Visual Studio shell and run it, you would do:

`C:\gmsh-git-Windows64-sdk> ren include\gmsh.h_cwrap gmsh.h`\
`C:\gmsh-git-Windows64-sdk> cl /Iinclude share\doc\gmsh\tutorial\c++\t1.cpp lib\gmsh.lib`\
`C:\gmsh-git-Windows64-sdk> cd lib`\
`C:\gmsh-git-Windows64-sdk\lib> ..\t1.exe`

Therefore the same rationale has to be adopted for Neutrino as well:
- after the installation of GMSH, the `gmsh.h_cwrap` file has to be renamed as `gmsh.h` (hence substituting it).
- the gmsh DLL file provided by the SDK should be then copied in all locations where every application later build with Neutrino is present, or moved to `C:\Windows\System32` and registered following this procedure: https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/how-do-i-register-dll-files-in-a-windows-10-64-bit/27429279-61ff-463b-bb77-3f30be2954ba as a 64-bit DLL for Windows 64-bit (notice that the 64-bit DLLs stay in `C:\Windows\System32` while the 32-bit ones stay in `C:\Windows\SysWoW64`).

This should make the GMSH's API working on Windows 10.

Continuing with the installation of Neutrino:

1. From the command shell (either VScode's or system's), navigate into *NeutrinoCodes* and create a `libnu` directory using the command:\
`mkdir libnu`\
\
This will create the `libnu` directory.

2. From the command shell (either VScode's or system's), navigate into *NeutrinoCodes* and clone the Neutrino project using the command:\
`git clone https://github.com/NeutrinoCodes/neutrino.git` \
\
This will create the `neutrino` directory.

3. Go to the `neutrino` directory and create a `.vscode` hidden directory:\
`cd neutrino`\
`mkdir .vscode`\
\
and create a new file `settings.json` in it, then fill it with the following information:\
`{`\
&nbsp;&nbsp;`"C_Cpp.default.configurationProvider": "vector-of-bool.cmake-tools",`\
&nbsp;&nbsp;`"cmake.configureArgs" : [   `\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`"-DGLAD_PATH=your_path_to_NeutrinoCodes/glad,`\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`"-DGLFW_PATH=your_path_to_NeutrinoCodes/glfw",`\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`"-DGMSH_PATH=your_path_to_NeutrinoCodes/gmsh",`\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`"-DNEUTRINO_PATH=your_path_to_NeutrinoCodes/libnu"`\
&nbsp;&nbsp;`]`\
`}`\
\
and save it.\
\
At this point, Neutrino is configured for your system. 

4. In VScode, go to the left bar and locate the **CMake** button (it comes after the installation of the CMake Tools extension for VScode) and push it: a CMake panel will open, push the **Configure All Projects** button on it.

5. In VScode, go to the bottom bar and locate the **Target** button: verify it has been selected to **[install]**.

6. In VScode, go to the bottom bar and locate the **Build** button: push it in order to build the Neutrino project.\
\
At this point the NeutrinoCodes directory should appear like this:
- glad
- glfw
- gmsh
- libnu
- neutrino

Congratulations, you have installed Neutrino on Windows!

# Post installation (recommended)

## Uncrustify:
We all like tidy code! For this, we provide an **Uncrustify** (sources: https://github.com/uncrustify/uncrustify) configuration file specific for Neutrino. In order to use it, please first install Uncrustify according to your operating system (e.g. use the Linux's package manager, or Homebrew under Mac or use these binaries: https://sourceforge.net/projects/uncrustify/ under Windows), then install the VScode's *Uncrustify extension* (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=LaurentTreguier.uncrustify).

According to your operating system, add the following lines to either the *global* or *project* **settings.json** file:

### Linux:
`"uncrustify.executablePath.linux": "your_path_to_uncrustify",`\
`"editor.defaultFormatter": "LaurentTreguier.uncrustify",`\
`"editor.formatOnSave": true`

### Mac:
`"uncrustify.executablePath.osx": "your_path_to_uncrustify",`\
`"editor.defaultFormatter": "LaurentTreguier.uncrustify",`\
`"editor.formatOnSave": true`

### Windows:
`"uncrustify.executablePath.windows": "your_path_to_uncrustify.exe",`\
`"editor.defaultFormatter": "LaurentTreguier.uncrustify",`\
`"editor.formatOnSave": true`\

To edit the *global* settings, on VScode go to the left bar: push the **Extensions** button and select the Uncrustify extension. Then go to **Manage --> Extension Settings** (gear-like icon) and edit the `settings.json` file by clicking one of the links in that section. This will set the Uncrustify code formatter globally in all your VScode projects (but still with per-project custom uncrustify configuration files).

To edit the *project* settings, open `settings.json` file in the `.vscode` you created for Neutrino (the hidden directory inside the `NeutrinoCodes` directory, see *Installation*) and put the same lines in it. This will set Uncrustify as code formatter (together with the configuration file we provide) only for the Neutrino project.

## Examples:
In order to test the installation of Neutrino and to start experimenting with it, please check the instructions present in the *Examples* repository: https://github.com/NeutrinoCodes/Examples.
